# Milestone Project - Twitch Promotion Page 

This website was made to promote my clients Twitch streaming channel.

They needed an online business card to show a bit about themselves, their streaming schedule, links to their social networks and
a contact page for future business opportunities.

The site also needed to promote an accompanying YouTube channel to the Twitch profile. This page of the site is here to show most
recent videos by the gaming group NLG and again provide a brief background to the group.


## UX

This website is for a 25 year old, male streamer who has just made affiliate on Twitch and is now going for partner. 

They wanted an online profile which shows their streaming schedule, their gaming group NLG and a place for contact about business.

To achive this I have made a page giving background information about my client such as where he's from and what games he will be 
streaming on the homepage, followed by a schedule page showing exactly when in the week you can expect to see him streaming. Following 
this I have implimented a page to promote his joint YouTube channel 'Nexx Level Gaming'. 

I have linked some of the latest videos and music we listen to while gaming/streaming to give an idea of what to expect from the channel. Finally I have made a contact page 
which currently has an inactive html form - as JavaScript was not allowed in this project - which will be made fully functional in 
the future.

been validated. In the future this page will have a validated form so users can get in contact with my client for business opportunities

## Testing

This site has been tested by myself in Chrome using developer tools to assess how the site would look on different devices
and viewports, for instance mobile and desktop.

Following this the site has been loaded up on my personal mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Bugs with pagelayout were seen 
in the tablet versions of the site during development but have now been fixed. 

I shared a link to the website to my NLG group chat to get the members to test the site on various devices from mobile to desktop.
Problems did arise here on some mobile devices such as the Google Pixel, but have now been sorted. A link was also shared to my 
Instagram account where over 100 followers decided to test the site across a nember of devices from mobile to desktop and give 
feedback. The results were very successful with only a couple feeding back with layout issues across tablets. These issues have 
now been resoved with added media queries for medium screen sizes. 

Finally, the main area for bugs (or errors in dev tools) came from the the NLG YouTube page. There were around 10 errors appearing
on this page which only left when my addblocker was turned off. This issues still has not been resolved but does not created any 
abnormalities witht he look or functionality of the page. 

## Deployment

This site was deployed on GitHub pages through the master branch.
